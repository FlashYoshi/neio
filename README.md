The Neio Markup Language
========================
Neio (read as "neo") is being developed as my thesis in the Master of Science in Computer Science Engineering at the University of Ghent.
The goal of Neio is to improve mainly on LaTeX, but also on other markup languages as Markdown or WYSIWYG editors like Word.

# Goals
* The file format should be simple to overcome data loss due to corruption of just one byte.
* The syntax should be easy to read and write to overcome the complexity of LaTeX and to allow people to jump right into the language.

# Libraries
* [Chameleon](https://github.com/markovandooren/chameleon)
* [Chameleon Support](https://github.ugent.be/tivervac/ChameleonSupport)
* [Jnome](https://github.com/markovandooren/jnome)
* [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/)
