Thesis
======
The subject of this Thesis is to create a markup language that improves mainly on LaTeX, but also on others as Markdown or WYSIWYG editors like Word.

The file format should be simple to overcome data loss due to corruption of just one byte.

The syntax should be easy to read and write to overcome the complexity of LaTeX and to allow people to jump right into the language.
