\section*{Chapter 1}
This is the first paragraph of our simple document.

\subsection*{Chapter 1.1}
But for this to be a real document we do of course need more than one chapter and more than one indentation level, so... voila!

\subsubsection*{Chapter 1.1.1}
Well LaTeX has one more level of indentation, so we should make use of it!

\section*{Chapter 2}
Lastly a chapter ending with two paragraphs should do the trick

This is the end of this very exciting document, but let's first try to make this paragraph a little longer. Only 80 characters per line when we have these giant screens is a bit outdated isn't it?
Let's also add some more newlines to see how we deal with those.
